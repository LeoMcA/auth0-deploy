## manual

This area is for manual-deploy of specific files, when auth0 does not yet support auto-deployment.
Ideally these should be moved to directories that can auto-deploy the code/templates/etc. in the future.

This mean any change to files in this directory will need to be manually mirrored in the auth0 setup.
